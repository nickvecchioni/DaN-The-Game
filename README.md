BYOW, standing for "Build Your Own World", is a 2D random world generation game I created my freshman year at UC Berkeley for CS 61B.
There are a few goals such as aquiring water, flowers, and power-ups (lore included), but the meat of the program is in generating the 
random worlds based on a given seed. The project contains 3 main folders: Core, Map, and Engine. Core contains the main
Java file in addition to a basic game engine that enables the game to run. Map contains all of the files needed for the random 
world generation, including functionality for randomly constructing hallways and rooms. TileEngine stores the files for creating
a visual representation of the game for the user, primarily utilizing a collection of colored tiles that have been predefined.
