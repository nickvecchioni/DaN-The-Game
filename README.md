# DaN The Game

DaN The Game is a 2D random world generation game I created my freshman year at UC Berkeley for CS 61B.

There are a few goals such as aquiring water, flowers, and power-ups (lore included), but the meat of the program is in generating the 
random worlds based on a given seed. 

`Core` contains the main Java file in addition to a basic game engine that enables the game to run. 

`Map` contains all of the files needed for the random 
world generation, including functionality for randomly constructing hallways and rooms. 

`TileEngine` stores the files for creating a visual representation of the game for the user, primarily utilizing a collection of predefined colored tiles.

Since this is a class project, only some files are provided as reference (in particular, to prevent blatant cheating.) Hence, this README does not provide instructions for running the program, nor does it go into great detail.
